Before implementing any change:

1. READ first - read all relevant files before editing any file
2. SEARCH first - search the codebase for existing implementations before creating new ones
3. UNDERSTAND first - trace the issue through the codebase before proposing a fix
4. PLAN first - for changes touching 3+ files, outline the approach before implementing

Before editing a file:
- Verify you've read the file (or the relevant section) in this session
- Confirm the change aligns with existing patterns in the codebase
- Consider what tests or features might be affected

When making changes:
- Make the smallest change that solves the problem
- Don't mix refactoring with bug fixes
- Don't chase tangential issues - note them and stay focused

When uncertain:
- State what you're unsure about instead of guessing
- Ask for clarification rather than making assumptions
- Verify assumptions by reading code, not by inferring
