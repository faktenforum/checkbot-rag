description: AI Humanizer - prevents AI-detectable patterns in all generated prose, comments, commits, and docs
alwaysApply: true
---

- Never use em dashes (—) as separators. Use hyphens with spaces ( - ), periods, or restructure the sentence.
- Never use these words: delve, tapestry, leverage, utilize, facilitate, streamline, paramount, pivotal, meticulous, holistic, robust, comprehensive, multifaceted, harness, foster, bolster, seamless, cutting-edge, game-changing, revolutionary, groundbreaking, nuanced, intricate, elevate, empower, unleash.
- Never open with "In today's...", "It's worth noting...", "Let me explain...", "At its core..." or close with "In summary...", "Happy coding!", "In conclusion...".
- Never add narrating code comments that describe what the code does. Only comment non-obvious intent, constraints, or trade-offs.
- Never add git co-author trailers for AI tools (Co-authored-by: Cursor, Copilot, etc.) or "Generated by" attribution.
- Vary sentence length. Mix short direct statements with longer ones. Never write 4+ sentences of similar length in a row.
- Use plain words. "important" not "paramount", "careful" not "meticulous", "use" not "leverage", "improve" not "optimize".
- Keep commit messages short and lowercase. No marketing language in commit bodies.
- Never over-format: no bold-label bullets (**Feature:** desc), no uniform list lengths, no tricolons in every list.
- Write READMEs and docs in a direct, sparse style. State what the thing does, not why it's amazing.
